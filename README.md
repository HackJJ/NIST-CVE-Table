# NVD Vulnerability Data Fetcher

This Python script fetches vulnerability data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and generates an AsciiDoc table. It is designed to extract information about vulnerabilities based on the provided URL and can filter results based on the age of the vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned and install the required dependencies:
   
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python script_name.py <URL> [max_months]
```

- `<URL>`: The URL of the NVD page from which you want to fetch data. This argument is required.
- `[max_months]`: The maximum age of the vulnerabilities to be fetched, in months. This argument is optional; if not provided, it defaults to 12 months.

For example:

```
python script_name.py 'https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Advanced&results_type=overview&search_type=all&isCpeNameSearch=false&cpe_vendor=cpe%3A%2F%3Aatlassian'
```

or

```
python script_name.py 'https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search/results?form_type=Advanced&results_type=overview&search_type=all&isCpeNameSearch=false&cpe_vendor=cpe%3A%2F%3Aatlassian' 6
```

The second command fetches vulnerabilities published in the last 6 months.
